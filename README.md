# Seed Phrase - Raid 5

Split your 24 word phrase across three sheets, so you have 
3x 12 words.  
One sheet can be lost or stolen without you having to worry.  

So, basically like RAID 5.  
Except this has nothing to do with disks.  
This is only using the binary XOR operation to generate redundancy.

## 🌿 Disclaimer

you are responsible for everything,
blah blah blah.


## ✅ Potential Feature Considerations

__Dropping one word per sheet__  
This would mean one has to brute force about
2048 * 2048 = 4194304 = 2 ** 22 possibilities to restore from two sheets.  
This would result in a restoration duration of still less than a second.  

Why doing it then?  
When having stolen one sheet, one had to guess the missing 12 plus 2 words.  
Meaning having to check 2 ** 132 * 2 ** 22 = 2 ** 154 Words.  
That is the difference between  
`5444517870735015415413993718908291383296` and
`22835963083295358096932575511191922182123945984`.  

If you would have been able to guess the missing 12 words in
ten seconds (!),
it would now take you 485 days 10 hours 50 minutes and 40 seconds.  

When working on a exponential scale, every bit makes a difference.

__Adding a password__  
One could use a password and generate a hash of 264bit.  
All words would be xor-ed with this hash.  
These new words can now be used to generated block A, B and X.  

If one has to restore the word list, one could restore A, B and X
as usual and now the password is required to generate the
264bit hash, and xor the word list back to normal.

This would be much more safe than dropping one word per sheet,
but it also requires the user to remember it.

## 🧮 How does it work?
Your 24 word will get divided into block A and block B,
with 12 words each.  
Then there will be block X generated as redundancy.  
X = A xor B

You enter your 24 words (reading this should make you _REEEEALLY_ uncomfortable).  
Then it will be split into part A, part B and a redundancy part X.

- If you lose X, you still have A and B.  
- If you lose A, with X you can restore B.  
- If you lose B, with X you can restore A.  


## 🔑 How can I do it securely?
_Paranoia mode_: _on_ 🕵️‍♀️

Do the following steps and you should be fine:  

__⚠️ #0 Do not trust this repository__  
Do not trust this code or this guide.  
Check the code for yourself.
If you are not a computer scientist, ask one you trust.


__🛡 #1 Get Tails__  
When you run the code to generate redundancy,  
you want to leave not a single bit of information when running this program.  
You might know the Tor Browser. Tails is from the same people.

Download it and install it to an USB stick.  
[Tails](https://tails.boum.org/index.de.html)


__💻 #2 Run Tails__  
Boot from the USB stick.  
You have to trust the hardware. If there is
a disk with malware (including the Windows OS), that's fine.

__🍍 #3 Get Rust__  
To generate this program from its source code, you need
the Rust compiler. I recommend rustup. 
[rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

__☕️ #4 Compile the program__  
Clone this code, or download it as zip and extract it.  
After installing Rust, you can run the following command
in a terminal with the working directory set to.
```bash
cargo build
```

__📡 #5 Secure your environment__  
_Paranoia mode_: _supercharged_
- Move the screen away from any windows.  
- Do not execute the process outdoors where someone might see you.  
  Also, spy satellites have really high resolutions these days.  
- Make sure your keyboard has no hardware keylogger installed.
- Make sure no person is with you.
- Make sure no one can record your keyboard clicks, processor ticks, etc.

_Very important:_
- Disable any possible way for the computer to connect to the internet.

__🔐 #6 Run the Program__  

Check again all points of chapter `#5 Secure your environemnt`.

Now run
```bash
cargo run
```
and follow the instructions.


__🍕 #7 Verify the Restoration__  
Pretend you lost the words from block A, and check if
the program can restore the words.

Now do the same as if you lost block B.

You do not have to check the loss of X,
as A + B is your original word list.


## A little bit of background (and math).
The words are from Bitcoin's Improvement Proposal BIP39.  
[Ian Coleman - BIP39](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).

Word 0 is `abandon`, and represents eleven zerobits.  
`00000000000`.  
Word 2047 is `zoo`, and represents eleven ones.  
`11111111111`.

This structure allows to xor two words and obtaining a third one.  
This is known as creating parity.

The following rules apply to the xor operation.

`A xor B = B xor A`  
`(A xor B) xor B = A`  
`(A xor B) xor A = B`  


24 words have 264 bits, with a little bit of
redundancy in itself.  
The information contained is 256 bits.  
The entropy is 256bit / 264bit = 0.97.

When having one sheet, one has 132bit and 128bit information.  
To bruteforce the remaining 128bit, one has to calculate up to  
`340282366920938463463374607431768211456` Hashes.  
To be honest, I have no clue how secure this actually is.  
(Could someone please calculate how long this would take for different super computers?)

If someone steals one of your sheets, move your funds, get new keys.
